# DBC-Final-Project-Frontend

•	SellMe is an online marketplace built to empower the buyer. Buyers post items they're interested in purchasing and sellers can submit competing bids to the buyer. This was our final project for Dev Bootcamp and was limited to 6 days of development. 

•	Our team decided to use AngularJs, a framework which we had a limited familiarity. We decoupled our AngularJs front‐end from the Rails API back‐end.

•	Developed the Search bar, Countdown ticker, Forms and API calls with AngularJs and Javascript on the front‐end.
